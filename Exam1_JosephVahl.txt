1. Yes, ecological modeling of populations of organisms should be considered a bioinformatics research area because bioinformaticists are essentially data scientists that have a strong science background in biology and biological systems and use their computing ability for this. Since their main job is to work with biological data, ecological modeling of populations of organisms would be an interesting area of research for someone in bioinformatics. 
2. False.
3. 1e-50

4. One way we can increase the copy number of our target DNA before sequencing is PCR. Another way is

5. Eukaryotes have 2 and prokaryotes have 3 genomes.

8.		1. Yes, https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/metapopulation-research-centre/glanville-fritillary-butterfly-genome-project
		2. There is no mention of various software other than what was used for the project which I mention in #3.
		3. Lep-Map Software, MIP Scaffolder, LiSs, Coral and HybridSHREC,PANNZER, EPT and SANS. 
		4. Yes
		5. If sequences are available to us, there is nothing more for us to do than create VCFs and annotated files from the sequence data. Different softwares will annotate variants differently and even call a different number of variants for analysis.

9. 		1. grep -c "^>" Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cds.all.fa			101933
